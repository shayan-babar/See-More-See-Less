                Palestine (Arabic: فلسطين, romanized: Filasṭīn[d]), officially the State of Palestine (دولة فلسطين,
                Dawlat Filasṭīn),[e] is a country in the southern Levant region of West Asia. It encompasses two
                disconnected territories — the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively known as the Palestinian
                territories — within the larger region of Palestine. The country shares its borders with Israel to
                north, west and south, Jordan to the east and Egypt to the southwest. It has a combined land area of
                6,020 square kilometres (2,320 sq mi) while its population exceeds five million people. Its proclaimed
                capital is Jerusalem while Ramallah serves as its administrative center and Gaza City was its largest
                city until massive population movements began in 2023 due to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza
                Strip.[3][4] Arabic is the official language. The majority of Palestinians practice Islam while
                Christianity also has a significant presence. The region of Palestine has played an important part in
                world history. The Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans and
                Byzantines all left their mark on the land. In addition to its historical significance, Palestine holds
                profound religious importance for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Throughout history the region has
                experienced periods of coexistence and conflict between different religious and ethnic groups. Notably,
                during the Middle Ages, when Jewish communities faced persecution, they found refuge and protection
                under Muslim rule and the wider Islamic world. The Ottoman Empire, which controlled Palestine from the
                16th century until its collapse at the end of World War I, provided a sanctuary for Jews fleeing
                persecution in Europe. The end of Ottoman rule marked a new chapter in Palestine's history. Following
                World War I, the British Empire assumed control of the region under the League of Nations mandate. The
                British Mandate for Palestine, established in 1920, brought significant changes to the political and
                social landscape of the area, setting the stage for the conflicts and struggles that would follow. The
                establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 was accompanied by a war which led to the forced
                displacement of 700,000 Palestinians and created a large refugee population.[19] Subsequent Arab–Israeli
                wars, including the Six-Day War in 1967, resulted in the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the
                Gaza Strip. On 15th November 1988, Palestinian National Council, the legislative body of the Palestine
                Liberation Organization (PLO) led by Yasser Arafat, declared the establishment of the State. Signing of
                the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, negotiated between Israel and the PLO, created the Palestinian Authority
                (PA) to exercise partial control over parts of Palestinian territories. In 2007, internal divisions
                between Palestinian political factions led to a takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas. Since then, the
                West Bank has been governed in part by the Palestinian Authority, led by Fatah, while the Gaza Strip has
                remained under the control of Hamas. Israel has built settlements in both of the Palestinian territories
                since the start of the occupation. The settlements in the Gaza Strip were dismantled in Israel's
                unilateral disengagement in 2005, and approximately 670,000 Israeli settlers live in settlements in the
                West Bank. The international community considers Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories illegal
                under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Currently, the biggest challenges to
                the country include the Israeli occupation, partial blockade, restrictions on movement, Israeli
                settlements and settler violence, as well as an overall poor security situation. Unsolved remain the
                question of Palestine's borders, the legal and diplomatic status of Jerusalem, and their right of
                return. Despite these challenges, the country remains one of the most highly-educated countries in the
                Arab world, maintains an emerging economy, and sees frequent tourism. As of June 2024, Palestine is
                recognized as a sovereign state by 144 out of 193 member states of the United Nations. It is also a
                member of several international organizations, including the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic
                Cooperation. It has been a non-member observer state of the United Nations since 2012.[20]
